        <p class="lead">Secret utilizes state-of-the-art security and end-to-end encryption to provide private messaging and Internet calling services to users worldwide (“Services”).

        <h3 class="cover-heading">Information we may share</h3>
        <p class="lead"><b>Third Parties. </b>We work with third parties to provide some of our Services.
